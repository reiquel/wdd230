                <b>Top-Rated Things to Do in Santo Domingo</b>
                <br><br>Santo Domingo's Zona Colonial is the highlight of this city and where most of the important tourist attractions are located. The old center is a delightful mix of history and modern Dominican life. Crumbling 16th-century ruins scattered between wonderfully restored colonial buildings are a constant reminder of this city's history.

                Founded by Christopher Columbus in the late 1400s, this first city of the New World is where Columbus lived and is buried. Today, the entire colonial district, Zona Colonial, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and many of the historic buildings house museums, restaurants, and hotels. 
                Most of the attractions and things to do described here are within the Zona Colonial. This area is relatively compact and easy to explore on foot, but with so much to see, it's easy to spend a few days here sightseeing and soaking up the atmosphere.  
                Narrow one-lane roads open onto parks with mature trees and old stone buildings. Outdoor restaurants, reminiscent of European cafés, offer inviting retreats from the heat of the day, where you can sit and watch life go by.
                Parque Colón (Columbus Park) and Plaza España are two of the main tourist hangouts and good places to start your tour. You'll find numerous restaurants in these areas, as well as official tour guides offering to show you around and providing information on things to do in Santo Domingo.<br><br>
                
                <hr><br><b>Catedral Primada de América</b><br>
                This impressive basilica, set on the south side of Parque Colón, was completed in 1540 and was the first cathedral built in the Americas. This is not a ruin but a functioning place of worship that still maintains many of the original features from the 16th century.
                <br><br>The original Mahogany doors open into the grand interior, where you can see the silver altar and a painting of the Virgin Mary from 1520. Although the real name is Basilica Cathedral of Santa María la Menor, tourist maps list this site as Catedral Primada de América.<br><br>

                <br><br>
                Location: South side of Parque Colón on Calle Arzobispo Meriño<br>

                <br><b>Panteón Nacional (National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic)</b><br>
                Originally constructed as a church in the first half of the 18th century, the building was converted to the national mausoleum in 1956 under the orders of dictator Rafael Trujillo to honor the country's most important people. In a twist he would not have envisioned, the building now houses, among others, the remains of the men who assassinated him.

                Also interred here are famous names such as Francisco Gregorio Billini, Gregorio Luperón, Eugenio María de Hostos, and José Gabriel García.

                The interior is beautiful, with marble tombs along the walls, arches, an ornately painted ceiling, and a huge Gothic-style chandelier. Opposite the entrance, at the end of a long red carpet, an eternal flame rises from the floor.

                Location: Calle Las Damas, one block south of the Museo de las Casas Reales<br><br>

                <br><b>Museo de las Casas Reales (Museum of the Royal Houses)</b><br>
                Built in the first half of the 16th century, this impressive structure was originally constructed on orders from Spain and designed to house the most important government offices of the New World. In the 1970s, it was turned into a museum to showcase the history and culture of the region.<br><br>

                <b>Where is Santo Domingo?</b><br>
                Santo Domingo, once known as Santo Domingo de Guzmán and Ciudad Trujillo, is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population.[5] As of 2022, the city and immediate surrounding area (the Distrito Nacional) had a population of 1,484,789, while the total population is 2,995,211 when including Greater Santo Domingo (the "metropolitan area"). The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional ("D.N.", "National District"), itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.
                
                <br><br>Founded by the Spanish in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama River and then moved by Nicolás de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World, the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo.

                <b>Climate</b>
                <br>The average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a borderline tropical rainforest (Köppen Af)/tropical monsoon climate (Am), as its driest month is very close to 60 millimeters (2.4 in). However, the city seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with warm days with less humidity and cool nights (temperatures of 17 to 19 °C (63 to 66 °F)). July through September are the hottest. Santo Domingo averages 1,445 millimeters (56.9 in) of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April; however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months.
                <br><br>
  
                <hr><br><b>Demographics</b><br>
                The demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas of the country, except that the population of immigrants (mainly Haitians) is larger in the city due to abundant jobs and economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well as a large immigrant community.

                <b>Languages</b><br>The Dominican Republic population is over 10 million, and more than 85% speak the official language. Most of those people live in the capital of Santo Domingo. In excess, more than half of the population is of a mixed origin. Therefore, there are many interesting differences that we will discuss. We have also prepared answers to the most common questions below. But first, let's take a look at the table how many percent of the population speaks these languages! 
                85% of the people speak spanish and 11% of the people speak english.<br><br>
