                <b>Top-Rated Things to Do in Santo Domingo</b>
                <br><br>Santo Domingo's Zona Colonial is the highlight of this city and where most of the important tourist attractions are located. The old center is a delightful mix of history and modern Dominican life. Crumbling 16th-century ruins scattered between wonderfully restored colonial buildings are a constant reminder of this city's history.

                Founded by Christopher Columbus in the late 1400s, this first city of the New World is where Columbus lived and is buried. Today, the entire colonial district, Zona Colonial, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and many of the historic buildings house museums, restaurants, and hotels. 
                Most of the attractions and things to do described here are within the Zona Colonial. This area is relatively compact and easy to explore on foot, but with so much to see, it's easy to spend a few days here sightseeing and soaking up the atmosphere.  
                Narrow one-lane roads open onto parks with mature trees and old stone buildings. Outdoor restaurants, reminiscent of European cafés, offer inviting retreats from the heat of the day, where you can sit and watch life go by.
                Parque Colón (Columbus Park) and Plaza España are two of the main tourist hangouts and good places to start your tour. You'll find numerous restaurants in these areas, as well as official tour guides offering to show you around and providing information on things to do in Santo Domingo.<br><br>
                
                <hr><br><b>Catedral Primada de América</b><br>
                This impressive basilica, set on the south side of Parque Colón, was completed in 1540 and was the first cathedral built in the Americas. This is not a ruin but a functioning place of worship that still maintains many of the original features from the 16th century.
                <br><br>The original Mahogany doors open into the grand interior, where you can see the silver altar and a painting of the Virgin Mary from 1520. Although the real name is Basilica Cathedral of Santa María la Menor, tourist maps list this site as Catedral Primada de América.<br><br>

                <br><br>
                Location: South side of Parque Colón on Calle Arzobispo Meriño<br>
                <br><hr>
                
                <br><b>Panteón Nacional (National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic)</b><br>
                Originally constructed as a church in the first half of the 18th century, the building was converted to the national mausoleum in 1956 under the orders of dictator Rafael Trujillo to honor the country's most important people. In a twist he would not have envisioned, the building now houses, among others, the remains of the men who assassinated him.

                Also interred here are famous names such as Francisco Gregorio Billini, Gregorio Luperón, Eugenio María de Hostos, and José Gabriel García.

                The interior is beautiful, with marble tombs along the walls, arches, an ornately painted ceiling, and a huge Gothic-style chandelier. Opposite the entrance, at the end of a long red carpet, an eternal flame rises from the floor.

                Location: Calle Las Damas, one block south of the Museo de las Casas Reales<br><br>
                <hr>
                
                <br><b>Museo de las Casas Reales (Museum of the Royal Houses)</b><br>
                Built in the first half of the 16th century, this impressive structure was originally constructed on orders from Spain and designed to house the most important government offices of the New World. In the 1970s, it was turned into a museum to showcase the history and culture of the region.<br><br><hr>
                <br><b>Plaza España</b>
                
                <br>Plaza España is a large and open square on the edge of the Zona Colonial, near the Rio Ozama. Frequently the site of events and public gatherings, this is not an intimate square where you would go to sit on a bench and sip a coffee under a tree.
                On the edge of the park are a number of restaurants with outdoor dining. Tour guides often hang out in the vicinity of the cafés and approach visitors to entice them into joining a walking tour.
                <br>
                On the square, opposite the restaurants and closer to the river, is the Alcazar de Colón. This former residence of the Columbus family is now a museum.
                Location: Calle La Atarazana, or the north end of Calle Las Damas, beyond the Museo de las Casas Reales
                <br><br>In summer, you can also visit the East Block to see 
                If all the historical buildings and the tight quarters of the Zona Colonial have you craving something more natural, take the 15-minute drive out to the 3 Eyes National Park. Be prepared to descend beneath the earth into lush and humid caverns, where you'll find crystal-clear waters in a series of four lakes.
                The lakes are spectacular and always glass calm, making it easy to see how they received their names. With a bit of imagination, you might think they look like blue-green eyes.
                The first lake you'll come to is called Aguas Azufradas, followed by La Nevera, then Lago de las Mujeres. To access the fourth lake, Los Zaramagullones, just pay a small fee and take a short and scenic boat ride. This lake can also be seen from above by following the walking trail to the overlook.<br>
                
                <br><b>Chu Chu Colonial Sightseeing Trolley</b>
                
                <br>The Chu Chu Colonial is a small, open-air sightseeing train that runs through Santo Domingo's Zona Colonial. While the area is quite small and easily walkable, on hot days the Chu Chu is a tempting option.
                The tour lasts about 45 minutes and lets you see the sights from the relative comfort of a shade-covered bench as it pulls you along cobbled streets and past the city's most famous sites. Keep an eye out for places you might want to visit after the tour. The tour starts from the east side of Parque Colón.  
                The Chu Chu Colonial runs every hour, 16 times a day.  
                Location: Parque Colón

                <br><b>National Botanical Gardens</b>
                
                <br>
                The National Botanical Gardens, known officially as the Dr. Rafael M. Moscoso Botanical Gardens, are a treasure of incredible biodiversity. The country has outdone itself with a garden that is comparable to many of the world's best. Situated on a hilltop offering good views out over the sprawling city below, the 400-acre garden is the largest in the Caribbean.
                Highlights of a visit here include the Japanese Gardens, a huge floral clock, and viewing over 300 species of orchids. It's a wonderful place to stroll or, if you'd rather, take the trolley that runs on a regular basis. Bird-watchers take note, this is one of the best places in Santo Domingo to see rare avian species.
                The botanical gardens are about 40 minutes from the Colonial Zone. Combine a trip here with a visit to the zoo.
                <br>

                <br><b>National Zoological Park</b>
                
                <br>Families traveling together will love taking a trip to the National Zoological Park. Not only is it a fun day all around, admission is very cheap when compared with zoo prices around the world. A wide assortment of animals are on offer from around the world, with some of the highlights being a rhino, white tiger, jaguars, monkeys, and emus.
                Kids will delight in riding the small train that passes by all the enclosures. Just hop on and hop off as you like. The zoo has recently undergone some renovation work in the main plaza, which has given it a nice refresh. Note that all the animal descriptions are in Spanish
                <br>

                <br><b>Monasterio de San Francisco</b>
                
                <br>The ruins of Monasterio de San Francisco are one of the most important historical sites in the Dominican Republic. The first monastery to be built in the New World, it stands as a symbol of the trials and tribulations that have inflicted this city throughout the centuries.
                The monastery has endured countless disasters, having been hit by hurricanes, devastated by earthquakes, sacked by Francis Drake, and used in battles, only to be repaired time and time again.
                The site is gated and fenced on all sides, so entry is not permitted. You can, however, see the interior from the main door. The ruins are still occasionally used as a venue for some events.
                It's a hot and sweaty walk uphill to visit this attraction. Fortunately several nearby restaurants offer cold drinks and pleasant shady spots to cool off.
                Location: Calle Hostos and Calle Juan Isidro Perez

                <b>Where is Santo Doming?</b><br>
                Santo Domingo, once known as Santo Domingo de Guzmán and Ciudad Trujillo, is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population.[5] As of 2022, the city and immediate surrounding area (the Distrito Nacional) had a population of 1,484,789, while the total population is 2,995,211 when including Greater Santo Domingo (the "metropolitan area"). The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional ("D.N.", "National District"), itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.
                
                <br><br>Founded by the Spanish in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama River and then moved by Nicolás de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World, the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo. It is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.[6][7] Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo (Spanish pronunciation: [sjuˈðað tɾuˈxiʝo]), from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.
                
                <br><br>Santo Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the vast majority of the country's most important industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic. Temperatures are high year round, with cooler breezes during winter time.
                <br><br>
                <hr><br>
                <b>Climate</b>
                <br>The average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a borderline tropical rainforest (Köppen Af)/tropical monsoon climate (Am), as its driest month is very close to 60 millimeters (2.4 in). However, the city seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with warm days with less humidity and cool nights (temperatures of 17 to 19 °C (63 to 66 °F)). July through September are the hottest. Santo Domingo averages 1,445 millimeters (56.9 in) of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April; however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months.

                Like many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. Hurricane Georges caused severe destruction in September 1998. The lowest recorded temperature has been 11.0 °C (51.8 °F) on 5 February 1951 and 7 January 1957 and the highest is 39.5 °C (103.1 °F) on 29 May 2002.[28]<br><br>
                <hr><br><b>Demographics</b><br>
                The demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas of the country, except that the population of immigrants (mainly Haitians) is larger in the city due to abundant jobs and economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well as a large immigrant community. In fact, over 20% of the city's population is composed of immigrants, mainly Haitians.[citation needed] However, there are also recent immigrants from Europe, Asia, as well as other Latin American nations present in the city. The city of Santo Domingo has a significant community of Asians (mainly Chinese), Arabs (mostly Lebanese), and Europeans (mostly Spanish and Italian people) are also present in the city. The northeast quadrant of the city is the poorest while the southwest is wealthier. Santo Domingo is also considered one of the epicenters of the growing Dominican middle-class. The city is one of the most economically developed cities in Latin America. Santo Domingo's population in 2010 was 3.8 million in the metropolitan area.

                <b>Languages</b><br>The Dominican Republic population is over 10 million, and more than 85% speak the official language. Most of those people live in the capital of Santo Domingo. In excess, more than half of the population is of a mixed origin. Therefore, there are many interesting differences that we will discuss. We have also prepared answers to the most common questions below. But first, let's take a look at the table how many percent of the population speaks these languages! 
                85% of the people speak spanish and 11% of the people speak english.<br><br>
